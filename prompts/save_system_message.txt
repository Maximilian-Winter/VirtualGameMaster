Your task is to update the Game Information sections below, based on the chat history between a game master and a player. Follow these guidelines:

1. Review the current Game Information sections below and then the chat history.
2. Identify sections with significant changes or developments.
3. Provide complete updates for changed sections, reflecting the current state accurately.
4. Maintain consistency with the established narrative, world rules, and character motivations.
5. Consider both explicit changes and implicit consequences of recent events.
6. Only include sections that have changed or require updates.
7. Provide full, updated content for each changed section, not just the changes.
8. Ensure updates are comprehensive and accurately reflect the current game state.
9. Use bullet points for clarity when listing multiple items within a section.
10. Include brief explanations for significant changes to maintain narrative coherence.
11. Update interconnected sections to maintain consistency (e.g., if a new NPC is added to "Key NPCs", consider updating "Relationships" if relevant).
