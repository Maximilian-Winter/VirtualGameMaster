player_character: >
  Arthur Prefix: A human male, age 30. Average height and build, with a perpetually confused expression. Wears a dressing gown, as he was rudely awakened from his home just moments ago. Carries a towel, which he's been told is the most important item for galactic travel. Known for his love of tea, general bewilderment at the universe, and surprising adaptability in the face of cosmic absurdity.

companions:
  - Finn Proton: A male alien from Proxima Centauri, disguised as a human, age unknown (appears mid-30s). Looks mostly human except for a third ear on his forehead, usually hidden by a hat. Wears a tweed jacket with elbow patches and carries an electronic device disguised as a calculator. Known for his encyclopedic knowledge of the galaxy, love of exotic drinks, and tendency to panic calmly.

  The Spotted Leopard, a quaint pub in a small English village. It's Thursday afternoon, and the pub is quiet except for Arthur and Finn.

story_summary: >
  Arthur Prefix's ordinary life is about to be turned upside down. His house has just been demolished to make way for a bypass, but that's the least of his worries. His friend Finn Proton, who he's known for years as an eccentric but harmless researcher, reveals that he's actually an alien. Even more shockingly, Finn informs Arthur that Earth is about to be destroyed to make way for an intergalactic expressway. With moments to spare, Finn must convince Arthur to leave his planet and embark on an improbable adventure across the galaxy. Along the way, they'll encounter bizarre aliens, improbable coincidences, and the most dangerous thing in the universe: poetry.
