The air is thick with the aroma of roasting meats and freshly baked bread, mingling with the murmur of conversations from patrons gathered at wooden tables or seated at the bar.\n\nYou notice a few travelers like yourselves, along with locals and merchants enjoying a respite from their daily routines. A bard in the corner strums a gentle melody on his lute, adding to the cozy atmosphere. Behind the bar stands a stout dwarf woman with a welcoming smile, her red beard neatly braided. She greets you warmly as you approach.\n\n\"Ah, welcome to 'The Fast Horse'! What can I get for ye tonight? Room, food, drink?\"\n\nYou take in the rustic charm of the inn's interior, noting the wooden beams adorned with horse-themed decorations - a nod to its name. A staircase leads up to what you assume are the guest rooms on the second floor.\n\nWhat would you like to do?\n\n(Respond as Elysia Thunderscribe)", "id": 1}]
