Update the Game Information based on recent events in the chat history. Follow these guidelines:
1. Thoroughly review all interactions since the last update.
2. Identify significant changes in plot, character development, world state, or game mechanics.
3. Update only the relevant sections where changes have occurred.
4. For each updated section, provide the complete current state, not just the changes.
5. Ensure updates are concise yet comprehensive, capturing all important details.
6. Maintain consistency with established narrative, character motivations, and world rules.
7. If adding new elements (e.g., NPCs, quests), ensure they logically fit within the existing narrative.
8. Pay special attention to updating 'story_summary', 'important_events', and 'active_quests' sections.
9. Reflect any changes in character relationships or development in relevant sections.
10. Update the 'time_and_calendar' section to reflect the current in-game time and date.
11. Consider both explicit changes and implicit consequences of recent events.
12. Use bullet points for clarity when listing multiple items within a section.
13. Highlight major changes or new information using appropriate emphasis (e.g., ** for bold in Markdown).
14. For the 'story_summary', append new developments rather than rewriting the entire summary.
15. In 'important_events', add new events and remove outdated ones if necessary.
16. For 'active_quests', update progress, add new quests, and remove completed ones.
17. Update interconnected sections to maintain consistency (e.g., if a new NPC is added, update 'relationships' if relevant).
18. Reflect character growth, including new skills, changing motivations, or altered perspectives.
19. Consider how recent events might affect the larger world state or faction relationships.
20. Subtly hint at future plot points or challenges when appropriate (foreshadowing).

Present only the sections that have been updated, using the original format and tags. Ensure each updated section is comprehensive and accurately reflects the current game state.
