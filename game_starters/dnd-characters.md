player_character: >
  Nyx Shadowweave: A Human female Wizard (School of Illusion) with glowing purple cybernetic eyes. Her neon blue hair is styled in an undercut, occasionally shimmering with arcane energy. In her late twenties, Nyx's gaze reflects a sharp intellect and years of arcane study. Her slender figure is draped in form-fitting black robes embroidered with intricate circuitry-like patterns that pulse with magic. She wields an ornate staff that doubles as a focus for her spellcasting and a tool for manipulating complex magical constructs. Despite her quiet demeanor, her aura exudes an air of formidable arcane power.

companions:
  - Scarlett Ironheart: A Human female Fighter with striking green eyes and short, spiky red hair. A prominent scar runs from her left temple to her jaw, a testament to her dangerous profession. In her early thirties, Scarlett's athletic build speaks of years of combat training. Her left arm is a masterwork of dwarven prosthetics, enhancing her already formidable fighting skills. Usually clad in well-maintained leather armor or practical adventuring gear, she carries an array of weapons with the ease of a veteran warrior. Despite her battle-hardened appearance, her eyes often sparkle with humor, especially when looking at Nyx.
