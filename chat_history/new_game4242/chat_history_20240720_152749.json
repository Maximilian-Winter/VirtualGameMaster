The common room is lively but not overcrowded, with travelers and locals alike exchanging stories over tankards of ale. The wooden floor is worn but clean, and the walls are adorned with various hunting trophies and faded tapestries depicting the inn's namesake\u2014a galloping horse with wind-blown mane.\n\nA jovial innkeeper, a portly man with a ruddy complexion and a bushy beard, stands behind the bar, polishing a mug. His eyes light up as he sees the two of you enter. \"Welcome, welcome!\" he calls out, his voice carrying a friendly warmth. \"What can I do for you fine ladies this evening? A room for the night, perhaps? And some supper to go along with it?\"\n\nLyra, her amber eyes gleaming with warmth, gives you a slight nod, as if to silently convey her agreement with the innkeeper's suggestion.\n\nNearby, a bard strums a lute softly in the corner, weaving a melody that adds an air of enchantment to the room. The flickering candlelight catches on Lyra's copper-red hair and your celestial-blue robe, making them shimmer with ethereal light.\n\nThe innkeeper continues, \"We've got a hearty stew tonight, along with fresh bread and a bit of roast pheasant. And if you fancy a drink, we've got ale, wine, and some fine elven mead.\"\n\nHow do you respond, and what would you like to do?", "id": 1}]
