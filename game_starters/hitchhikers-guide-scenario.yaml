player_character: >
  Arthur Dent: A human male, age 30. Average height and build, with a perpetually confused expression. Currently wearing a dressing gown, as he was rudely awakened and rushed out of his house. Carries a towel, recently given to him by Ford. Known for his love of tea, general bewilderment at the universe, and his house which is about to be demolished to make way for a bypass.

companions:
  - Ford Prefect: A male alien from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, disguised as an out-of-work actor, age unknown. Looks human, carries a satchel containing a trusty electronic thumb, a Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic, and a copy of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Known for his ability to see the big picture, his love of Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters, and his catchphrase "Don't Panic".

  The Horse and Groom, a local pub in the English countryside. It's Thursday lunchtime, and Ford has just convinced Arthur to go for a few pints to calm his nerves about his house's imminent demolition.

story_summary: >
  Arthur Dent's thoroughly ordinary Thursday is about to become extraordinary. His house is scheduled for demolition to make way for a bypass, but that's just the start of his problems. His friend Ford Prefect, who Arthur has known for years as a bit of an oddball, reveals that he's actually an alien researcher for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Even more shockingly, Ford informs Arthur that Earth is about to be destroyed by a Vogon Constructor Fleet to make way for a hyperspace bypass. With mere minutes to spare, Ford must convince Arthur to leave his planet and hitchhike across the galaxy. Their improbable adventure will involve Vogon poetry, Babel fish, and the search for the Ultimate Question to Life, the Universe, and Everything.
