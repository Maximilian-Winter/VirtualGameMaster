The innkeeper, a stout man with a ruddy complexion and a welcoming smile, nods at Elysia and Lyra as they find a quiet corner to settle into. The warm glow of the hearth casts dancing shadows across the room, and the scent of roasted fowl and fresh-baked bread fills the air.\n\nElysia's indigo eyes scan the room, taking in the patrons: merchants discussing trade over pints of ale, a bard tuning his lute by the fire, and a group of adventurers recounting tales of their exploits with animated gestures. Her celestial-blue robe catches the firelight, making the runic symbols shimmer as if alive.\n\nLyra, her fiery hair a stark contrast to the cool tones of the room, leans back in her chair, her gaze lingering on the gleaming longsword propped against the table. The shifting amber of her eyes reflects the flickering flames, hinting at the magic that flows through her veins.\n\nThe innkeeper approaches, setting down a pair of frothy ales and a platter of food before them. \"Evening, ladies. I hope your journey was without incident,\" he says with a friendly tone. \"You'll find the roads can be treacherous this time of year, what with bandits and the like.\"\n\nHe glances at Elysia's staff, curiosity flickering in his eyes. \"Might I ask what brings a wizard and her companion to these parts? Folks around here don't often see your kind, and it's always interesting to hear the tales you tell.\"\n\nElysia, as the innkeeper awaits your response, what do you wish to share about your travels, if anything? And what, if any, are your intentions for the coming days?", "id": 1}]
