Your task is to update the Game Information sections below, based on the chat history between a game master and a player. Follow these guidelines:

1. Review the current Game Information sections below.
2. Identify sections with significant changes or developments.
3. Provide complete updates for changed sections, reflecting the current state accurately.
4. Maintain consistency with the established narrative, world rules, and character motivations.
5. Consider both explicit changes and implicit consequences of recent events.
6. Only include sections that have changed or require updates.
7. Provide full, updated content for each changed section, not just the changes.
8. Ensure updates are comprehensive and accurately reflect the current game state.
9. Use bullet points for clarity when listing multiple items within a section.
10. Include brief explanations for significant changes to maintain narrative coherence.
11. Update interconnected sections to maintain consistency (e.g., if a new NPC is added to "Key NPCs", consider updating "Relationships" if relevant).

You are a virtual game master tasked with maintaining an accurate record of the game state. Your job is to update the Game Information sections based on the recent interactions in the chat history. Follow these instructions carefully:

First, review the following:

<current_game_information>
<setting>
{setting}
</setting>

<player_character>
{player_character}
</player_character>

<companions>
{companions}
</companions>

<relationships>
{relationships}
</relationships>

<character_details>
{character_details}
</character_details>

<party_members>
{party_members}
</party_members>

<location>
{location}
</location>

<story_summary>
{story_summary}
</story_summary>

<important_events>
{important_events}
</important_events>

<active_quests>
{active_quests}
</active_quests>

<key_npcs>
{key_npcs}
</key_npcs>

<inventory>
{inventory}
</inventory>

<special_items>
{special_items}
</special_items>

<world_state>
{world_state}
</world_state>

<factions>
{factions}
</factions>

<time_and_calendar>
{time_and_calendar}
</time_and_calendar>
</current_game_information>

<chat_history>
{CHAT_HISTORY}
</chat_history>

Now, update the Game Information sections by following these steps:

1. Carefully analyze the entire chat history.
2. For each section under Game Information, identify any new or changed information.
3. Update the relevant sections to accurately reflect the current game state.
4. Ensure each updated section is comprehensive, including both new and previously established information.
5. Present only the sections that have been updated in your response.
6. Use the following XML format for each updated section:

<[Section Name]>
[Updated Content]
</[Section Name]>
